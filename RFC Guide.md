# RFC Guide

## OVERVIEW
This guide is designed to familiarize Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) recruiting officers (RO) with detachment-level recruiting responsibilities and processes. It also provides tips and recommendations from the field to assist ROs in their duties. 

## CHAPTER 1 – RECRUITING PROGRAM
Detachment-Level Recruiting. ROs are an integral part of the detachment dynamics. They manage detachment activities to recruit in-college, high school, and enlisted members from the local area. Recruiting emphasis generally shifts between these markets based on the time of year with scholarship deadlines, college orientation, and class registration schedules. Detachment cadets are ROs’ most valuable recruiting tools. The cadets bring energy and charisma to recruiting events while also relating closely to candidates because they were most recently in the same position before joining AFROTC.

## CHAPTER 2 – RECRUITING PLAN
Recruiting Plan. Recruiting plans provide a source of continuity to identify detachment recruiting objectives, available markets, and a list of recruiting events. ROs must review previous years’ recruiting plans to analyze strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for the purpose of setting future goals. At a minimum, the recruiting plan will include the following items:
- Record of Review
- Table of Contents
- Summary
  - AOR Map
  - Five-Year History 
  - Summary of Previous Recruiting Plan Results  
  - Recruiting Successes and Challenges  
- Recruiting Objectives  
- Target Market
- Time-Phased List of Events (TPLE)
- Points of Contact

### Record of Review 
Recruiting plans must be approved by the RO and detachment commander.

### Table of Contents

### Summary
#### General Summary of Detachment Recruiting Environment
List all of the cross-towns for the university and the general environment for recruiting.

#### Area of Responsibility (AOR) Map
This map identifies where the detachment RO is responsible for the high school scholarship program (HSSP) interviews and presentations while identifying all potential market areas.

#### Five-Year History of Officer Production
List, by fiscal year, the numbers of commissioned officers produced by the detachment over the last five years.

#### Summary of Previous Recruiting Plan Results
The summary must include after action report (AAR) annual results, HSSP direct results, enrollment increase, and program guidance Letter (PGL) impact.

#### Recruiting Successes & Challenges
ROs should be honest in this assessment and take time to examine previous successes and failures to maximize future results. This requires realistic measures of success that are set prior to each event.

#### Recruiting Objectives
Specific production numbers are at the discretion of the detachment, and should be realistic and representative of the potential target market (e.g., setting diversity goals for the detachment that are commiserate with the university’s demographics.)

#### Target Market
ROs should primarily focus their efforts on their target market as listed below. Developing relationships with influencers (person or group that has the ability to influence the decision of a lead) will aid in creating a referral pipeline freeing up time to shift or expand efforts to other feeder schools, and/or nationally ranked high schools in the immediate vicinity. If you are recruiting outside the detachment target market, the RO must provide general AFROTC information rather than detachment-specific information. The RO target markets are as follows:
  - Tier 1: Host or crosstown schools, top 10 host or crosstown feeder high schools, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) focused schools, top 25 high schools in area (reference US News and World Report). Top 10 Feeder High Schools. Feeder high schools are determined by your host and cross-town schools. These are not the top 10 feeder high schools into the detachment but into the universities your detachment serves. In most cases, cadets choose the institution first and the detachment by default.
  - Tier 2: Other top 100 high schools (reference US News and World Report) and Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFJROTC) units.
  - Tier 3: Other top ranked high schools within a 50-mile radius.

### Time-Phased List of Events (TPLE)
Provides a detailed catalog of the recruiting events that ROs will accomplish in order to reach their target markets. The TPLE should cover the time period from 1 July to 30 June and should be recorded in the AAR found in Teams under ROTC Recruiting Branch-ROs Det Cadre-Plans & AARs ROs All Regions. Include events at the host and cross-town schools, feeder high schools, and points of contact for each. When updating the plan, indicate if an event is worth holding again next year and note any specific materials or items needed for the event. These notes should be clear, concise, and easily understood by the next RO. The TPLE is a living document that can be adjusted or updated to meet the recruiting plan objectives.

### Points of Contact
The plan should include a list of key campus contacts such as: admissions office, financial aid office, orientation coordinators, marketing departments, department chairs for STEM majors, nursing, high demand foreign languages, and the guidance counselors for feeder high schools. The plan must contain the contact info for the other United States Air Force (USAF) recruiting assets including, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Admissions Liaison Officers (ALO), local AFJROTC detachments, local Air Force Recruiting Service (AFRS) recruiter, and Air Force Reserve Component (ARC) recruiters operating in the RO’s AOR.

### Deadlines. 
A biennial recruiting plan must be submitted to the Det/CC for approval. Detachments are no longer required to submit their recruiting plans to HQ. The recruiting plan is a living document and should be updated as necessary.

### Resources
There are a variety of resources ROs can utilize to improve the recruiting climate in their AOR.
Joint Advertising, Market Research, and Studies (JAMRS) reports can give ROs a better understanding of the recruiting market. ROs can establish a JAMRS account at http://dmren.org/app/login?next=/.

University demographics are a great resource for ROs to gauge the diversity of their detachment as it should be on par with the university’s demographics. If not, improving diversity should be a recruiting plan objective as the market clearly offers the means to support a more diverse cadet corps.

Some universities will poll inbound students for AFROTC interest in their entrance surveys. These rosters are a valuable resource that puts you in contact with potential applicants. If the university does not currently poll incoming students on their military interest, ask if they would be willing to request this information.

Request a Solomon Amendment Report from the university registrar’s office, which can provide rosters with contact information on potential applicants. Information can include telephone, age, date of birth, email address, academic major, etc. The 1996 Solomon Amendment is the popular name of Title 10 United States Code § 983, a United States federal law that allows the Secretary of Defense to deny federal grants to institutions of higher education if they prohibit or prevent military recruitment, including AFROTC, on campus.

If the university has a listing of student organizations, you may be able to identify groups to engage with that are targeted by the National Recruiting Strategy (e.g. STEM, diversity, etc.). 

### Recruiting Plan Examples and Checklist. 
Recruiting plan examples are provided on Teams under ROTC-Recruiting Branch (RRR)-ROs Det Cadre-Files-Example Recruiting Plans. The recruiting plan  checklist is provided on Teams under ROTC-Recruiting Branch (RRR)-General-Files-RO Training, Continuity, Guides, and Templates-Recruiting Plans

### Tips and Recommendations in the Execution of the Recruiting Plan
#### Phase 1. Planning
Verify all contact information from the previous year’s plan. Ensure you update the high schools’ info before they close for the school year to ensure you have accurate information to begin scheduling visits when academics resume.

Be ambitious in planning, put a lot of events on the calendar, so if you miss some, it will not impact your production goals.

Use organizational email addresses versus personal accounts whenever possible. People change frequently, but organizations do not.

Obtain physical mailing addresses for feeder high schools to send AFROTC material when visiting the campus is not feasible.

Leverage the cadet recruiting officer at your detachment. Cadet ROs can coordinate with public affairs and community involvement officers to maximize awareness of the detachment. Cadet ROs should know the university, be highly organized, and have extroverted personalities to the greatest degree possible. Cadet ROs will ensure recruiting opportunities are manned by cadets as needed, all cadets have been trained by the cadre prior to recruiting events, and all necessary recruiting material is prepared prior to the event. Competent cadet ROs should be allowed to innovate and experiment to leverage every opportunity open to the detachment.

Leverage your cadets’ knowledge of the school/life as a cadet. After you have provided required training/talking points, put the cadets out front at on-campus events. College students are more likely to talk to someone their age.

Whenever possible, send at least two people to recruiting opportunities. It provides more flexibility; you can talk to more people at once, and it assists in appearances.

Find college fairs in your AOR (usually held in the fall to coincide with application deadlines). These college fairs are excellent resources to speak with multiple students (and parents) from different parts of the state. Team up with other recruiting assets to attend these events, especially if there is a fee involved. The university admissions office may be able to provide some college fair information.

Meet the other recruiters (AFRS, USAFA, and ARC/ANG) covering your AOR to collaborate and de-conflict when possible. Presenting a united front not only saves resources and eliminates duplicate efforts but also leaves a better impression of the USAF. Multiple AF recruiters showing up only days apart is confusing to most counselors. Be able to make by name referrals when prospects do not meet AFROTC requirements. Likewise, ensure other recruiters have your information to give to those interested in AFROTC. You can find an enlisted recruiter based on zip code at www.airforce.com and the local USAFA ALO based on a high school at https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/outreach-programs/find-your-admissions-liaison-officer/.

Attend training at USAFA ALO area annual meetings, brief them on the AFROTC HSSP process, and provide them with AFROTC materials such as brochures and special promotion items.

Coordinate with USAFA ALOs to inquire with congressional offices to see if they will allow AFROTC participation in their recruitment events for the military academies--Service Academy Night.

Make a good faith effort to contact or visit each cross-town school at least once a year. Introduce yourself to admissions teams and advisors and provide them with business cards and recruiting information to distribute to interested students.

If your school has a marketing or public affairs program, request a market analysis. This assignment will likely be tasked out as a project for an advanced group of students and can provide tailored insights about your zone at no cost.

Know your school’s freshman/new student orientation programs. These programs may be spread across multiple offices and points of contact (POCs), so cultivate relationships there and know the school timelines to sign up. Request the detachment’s email address be added to the distribution list so you will receive all emails regarding these events. Attend all the opportunities you can to increase awareness and to answer questions.

Know your local AFJROTC/Civil Air Patrol (CAP) units (if applicable). AFJROTC and CAP units are great target markets due to their general understanding of the military. Talk with the AFJROTC and CAP commander and make sure he/she understands the current AFROTC application process and HSSP application deadlines.

Reach out to the STEM departments at your university. Ask to give a quick five-minute presentation to a STEM freshman orientation level class. Provide your business card and brochures to academic advisors in these departments so they can send interested students your way.

Reach out to the technical and minority student organizations at your university and cross-town universities to provide information on AFROTC.

Know your school’s fraternity/sorority rush process. Can you use their process to your advantage to raise your detachment’s profile with students already seeking to join something greater than themselves? Do this prior to drop/add date.

Detachments should have a dedicated space to talk with prospective students/families. If able, place marketing materials in the room to help the student make a decision about joining.

Have a plan for when families/students visit the detachment. Have handouts ready that you can show them while you discuss AFROTC opportunities.

If your university allows, offer shadow days for parents and prospective students to participate in a class or leadership laboratory (LLAB). Provide them the opportunity to interact with current cadets. Universities are often in session during high school spring breaks, so this may be a prime time to host shadow days.

Use data from the Joint Advertising, Market Research and Studies (JAMRS) analysis to focus your recruiting efforts and make the most efficient use of the recruiting timeline.

#### Phase II. Interaction
Be prepared to be told “no” by the majority of people you speak with. Be respectful of that choice and avoid a “hard sell.” You are offering students an opportunity, they have to choose to accept it. Be aware of parents that are more interested than their child in AFROTC as this is not a recipe for success.

When talking to incoming freshmen, emphasize the network/camaraderie they gain by participating in AFROTC. Discuss the opportunities, fitness, public speaking, summer professional development trainings (PDTs), etc.

Let students know if your university provides any added benefits for AFROTC cadets. Some schools provide free room and board to students who participate in AFROTC or are on a scholarship with AFROTC. Additionally, some schools even offer in-state tuition just for participating in AFROTC.

Keep your message simple. Make sure your language is as civilian friendly as possible and avoid acronyms on your presentation slides and your verbal remarks. Do not bury them in information; have three main points such as college education, opportunity to serve, and guaranteed job after graduation. However, it is important to tailor your message to your audience. People that are interested in knowing more will approach you after the presentation or contact your office.

Establish realistic expectations of the AFROTC program. AFROTC demands time and effort from each cadet. Promote incentives for enrolling in AFROTC at the university (e.g., priority registration, room/board rates, scholarships specifically for cadets, etc.). Tell students what your program requires, events and timeframes, and then tell them if your program has extracurricular activities. Does your university or crosstowns offer early enrollment or scholarships specifically for AFROTC students?

Let students know that they will be graduating with a career while their peers are filling out applications and writing resumes.

Be familiar with the very basic medical requirements (Cadet Medical Processing Guide), but refer prospects to the Department of Defense Medical Review Board (DoDMERB) at 719-333-3562 if they have additional questions.

An email template repository can greatly speed-up responses to general inquiries by interested students. While each student’s individual questions should be addressed, many students just make a general request for information.

#### Phase III. Follow-up
Follow-up is key to turning a contact into a cadet! Within 48 hours of the initial interaction, reach out to the contact via email or phone call. As you interact with individuals, you should gather more information about them; they can be placed into two main categories: a contact and a lead. Contacts are anyone just requesting information. A lead is someone that you have verified meets the minimum criteria to join AFROTC or is qualified to apply for a HSSP. Once a person signs up for AFROTC classes, they will then be considered a cadet.

Match leads with a like-major cadet via email or in-person meeting.

Manage your contact worklist in WINGS, and follow-up with leads consistently to move them through the recruitment process.

Provide an orientation guide or welcome packet to incoming students.

## CHAPTER 3 – LEAD AND INFLUENCER MANAGEMENT 
### Overview
Upon completion of a recruiting opportunity, ROs should follow-up with leads and influencers. WINGS is the AFROTC customer relationship management system and facilitates lead management; therefore, all AFROTC recruiters must enter their leads into WINGS.  

### Guidance and Expectations
Every lead’s contact information must be entered into and managed via WINGS. ROs may maintain a running spreadsheet with contacts and leads or an email organizational system but are required to input data into WINGS weekly. To enter contact information into WINGS, after logging in, go to Recruiting/Admissions  Contact Search, enter data into at least one field (last name works best), and check the box next to the Submit button. If the lead or influencer is already in the system, click their last name to edit their information. If the lead or influencer does not have an entry in the system, click Create New (See Figures 3.1. – 3.3.). Enter all applicable information and click Save. Initial contact options are as follows:
1. Blue Card – Postcards that leads fill out at events and mail in.
2. High School Visit/Presentation – A RO or Gold Bar visit to a high school.
3. High School College Fair – Leads gained from high school hosted college fairs.
4. AFJROTC – Leads interested based on AFJROTC participation.
5. College/Job Fair – Leads generated from college or job fairs.
6. Air Show – Leads generated from an air show.
7. Community Event – Leads generated from local events.
8. Cold Call – Leads called the National Call Center, RDA, or detachment.
9. Direct Mail – Leads generated in response to direct mail campaigns.
10. Online AFROTC Application – Lead submitted a HSSP or admissions application.
11. AFROTC.com – Leads generated from visiting the AFROTC website.
12. Detachment Website – Leads contacted detachment via the detachment’s website.
13. Direct Leads Database – Leads transferred from Department of Defense (DoD) database.
14. Scholarship Presentation – Leads generated from seeing an HSSP presentation.
15. AFROTC Cadet Referral – Leads heard about AFROTC from a cadet.

### Managing Leads
Once a lead’s contact information has been documented in WINGS, they need to be classified to identify their progression in the recruiting process. Classifying leads will help you focus on encouraging the lead to take the next step in the recruiting process and allows you to appropriately manage your lead pipeline to determine when you need to invest in more prospecting/lead generating activities. Additionally, Headquarters AFROTC Recruiting Branch (AFROTC/RRR) will use this information to gauge and credit recruiting efforts nationwide.

### Classification Categories
Leads will be classified based on the following categories:
- **Category 0 – Disqualified/No Interest.** Place a contact in this status if they have been disqualified, are no longer interested, or it has been determined the contact should be abandoned due to lack of response or willingness to commit. This classification removes the contact from your worklist.
- **Category 1 – Initial Contact.** Place a lead in this status after the first time the RO contacts the individual after collecting the lead’s information. Initial contact must occur within one week of receiving the lead’s information.
- **Category 2 – Follow-up Contact.** Place a lead in this status if the individual responds to initial contact and continues dialogue. Lead will remain in this status until a committed action is taken or the lead is disqualified or abandoned.
- **Category 3 – Committed Applicant.** Place a lead in this status if the individual has applied to join AFROTC or applied for HSSP. Once this lead is gained as a cadet, the lead is removed from all contact worklists.
- **Cadet.** Place a lead in this status once they have enrolled in AFROTC classes or accepted a HSSP scholarship. Once this lead is gained as a cadet by the detachment, the lead is removed from all contact worklists.
- **Influencer.** Category can be used to assist with tracking/engaging key influencers in a recruiter’s AOR.
- **TBD – To be determined.** This is the status assigned to all new leads until they can be further categorized.

### Monitoring Leads
The contact worklist identifies HSSP applicants, interviewees, and contains names of applicants completing the AFROTC admissions process; managing it properly will ensure success and an efficient process.

ROs and Gold Bar recruiters (GBR) will update the contact worklist on at least a weekly basis to maintain accuracy. Keeping this information up-to-date will provide an accurate tracking of the AFROTC recruiting pipeline and allow other personnel to continue the recruiting process at any time if necessary.

When a GBR enters in a lead, he/she will assign that lead to their own detachment; he/she will also assign that contact to themselves by using the “Gold Bar Assigned” drop-down menu. This will aid in de-conflicting leads entered by GBRs and ROs at the same detachment. GBRs can also assign a lead to a different detachment worklist and GBR if a lead expresses specific interest in another school.

All correspondence with leads will be tracked within WINGS for record-keeping, lead management, and recruiter effectiveness purposes.

## CHAPTER 4 – MARKETING
### Overview
ROs are responsible for AFROTC marketing in their AOR. This responsibility consists of procuring and distributing AFROTC material, developing and distributing detachment-specific advertising, and the planning and execution of center of influence (COI) events.

### Resources
ROs will plan, manage, and submit marketing requests on Teams under ROTC-Recruiting Branch (RRR)-ROs Det Cadre-Marketing Request Form. ROs can use the form to order AFROTC special promotional items (SPI) and detachment-specific advertising and request approval for COI events.

### Special Promotional Items
These items consist of generic AFROTC-produced marketing materials and brochures. Funding for SPI will be provided by AFROTC and may vary from year to year.

### Detachment-Specific Advertising and Promotional (A&P) Items
ROs are responsible for developing, requesting approval from AFROTC/RRR, and distributing detachment specific advertising/marketing. Funding for local detachment advertising and promotional material will be provided by AFROTC and may vary from year to year. Once money is available and loaded to a specific account, the amount will be posted on Teams and announced via an Automated Reserve Officer Training Corps Messaging System (ARMS) message.

Print media and multimedia management. All print media and multimedia must be approved by AFROTC/RRR annually. Creating a tracker to refer to when certain items are up for renewal will be very beneficial.

A&P Funds Management. A&P funds are exclusively for attracting new recruits. They cannot be used to purchase items for current cadets or cadre (e.g. beautification of detachment, items focused on retention, etc).

Use the following guidelines and restrictions to create or revise locally developed material.

All locally developed advertisement/promotional materials must clearly display the AFROTC logo and contact information (e.g. local telephone number and/or detachment website). The USAF symbol must remain proportional when sizes change.

Broadcast Media. Radio and television are very valuable when trying to reach a target market. Products are furnished by AFRS to AFROTC/RRR and can be distributed upon request by ROs to radio and television stations.

Public Service Announcement (PSA) Radio Spots. PSA radio spots can be ordered through AFRS (call commercial 210-565-0522). ROs can contact the radio station to request PSA airtime.

PSA television spots. PSA television spots cannot be purchased by AFROTC detachments. Each quarter, current generic USAF PSA products are produced by AFRS and sent directly to television stations throughout the country.

All detachment-specific broadcast media must be approved by HQ AFROTC/RRR prior to release.

To complete an advertising or promotional request, ROs will contact the vendor and arrange for services. Ensure the vendor does not perform work until authorized by AFROTC/RRR. Most states will exempt the federal government from paying taxes on purchases. Ask vendors to exempt the taxes. If the vendor states they will not exempt federal purchases from taxes, find another vendor that will exempt taxes.

The RO is responsible for ensuring the product will meet the needs of AFROTC. You must obtain a proof of the product before AFROTC/RRR purchases the product in quantity.

ROs will submit the request to purchase detachment-specific advertising and promotional items on Teams under ROTC-Recruiting Branch (RRR)-ROs Det Cadre-Marketing Request Form.

### Resources
Here are a few vendors that ROs have found useful when purchasing detachment-specific advertising and promotional materials. No federal endorsement intended. The names of other similar vendors can be added upon request.

- LeaderPromos – https://www.leaderpromos.com, Phone: 877-677-9988
- Quality Logo Products – https://www.qualitylogoproducts.com

### COI Events
ROs can enhance recruiting operations by hosting events designed to promote AFROTC opportunities to highly qualified leads and/or key influencers of highly qualified leads and/or applicants. AFROTC/RRR is the approval authority for all AFROTC funded COI events. Examples of COI event requests can be found in Attachment 1.

#### Event Planning
Determine specific recruiting objectives for the event and create the appropriate invite list.

Plan all activities at least 30 days before the event to allow enough time to overcome problems and to provide a professional event. Detachments must adhere to all end-of-fiscal-year funds obligation and execution deadlines.

Request funding for the event through X-Net at least 15 days prior to the event. Approval or disapproval of the event will be posted via X-Net.

Negotiate COI events only with vendors agreeing not to charge for no-shows. If a vendor will not agree to this, and the RO still believes this is the best offer, contact AFROTC/RRR for a waiver via X-Net.

Once an approval is secured, HQ AFROTC/RRR will make payment for food, drinks, and gratuity via a government purchase card (GPC). If the vendor does not accept the GPC, make every effort to secure another vendor. If no other vendor is available, contact AFROTC/RRR for assistance.

Complete the after-action portion of the COI request via X-Net no later than five duty days after the COI event. Any deviations from the original request must be annotated in the after-action report.

COI Funds Management. COI funds are exclusively for consumable items (i.e. food and beverages excluding alcoholic beverages) and gratuity expenses. Complimentary alcoholic beverages cannot be, or appear to be, offered. COI funds cannot be used to pay for items such as plates, napkins, cups, plasticware, charcoal, skate rental, greens fees, etc. Title 10 United States Code § 520c specifies small meals and drinks at recruiting functions are permitted. Small meals are not sit down meals at a steak house, pasta restaurant, etc.

There are only two categories of COI attendees:
- Lead – person eligible for AFROTC.
- Guest – person not eligible for AFROTC. These are most often people with direct influence over qualified students (e.g., counselors, instructors, school officials, parents/guardians).

Events may not exceed $500 in total cost, $20 per guest as referenced in AFRS Instruction (AFRSI) 65-601.

Waiver Process. Under certain circumstances, the standards established for COI events may not meet the needs of the event.

Excessive cost waiver. At the discretion of the AFROTC/CC, COI events may exceed the $500 maximum cost. Waivers for these events must be pre-approved by the Det/CC prior to COI action officer approval. Failure to provide the Dec/CC approval will delay the waiver process.

General waiver. All other waivers will be entered into X-Net and evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Attendance. An organized guest attendance roster must be used at COI events. Example rosters are provided on the RRR Intranet site. Collect name and contact information at a minimum. Personal information such as a social security number is not collected on this roster. When soliciting information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 from leads, the following statement must be read, given, or shown to persons signing in: “We will be happy to provide you more information about USAF opportunities as authorized by Title 10 United States Code § 503 and governing directives for AFRS. The information solicited will be used to determine eligibility and to allow follow-up contact. The routine use of this information will be for USAF recruiting purposes only. Providing the information is voluntary; however, failure to provide sufficient information may prevent action on your inquiry.”

At a maximum, you may only have one military member (cadre or cadet) for every three civilian leads or guests (i.e., if there are two cadre members and one cadet in attendance there should be nine leads or guests in attendance as well).

Limit military personnel to those with a role in the COI event such as the guest speaker, appropriate escort ratios (3:1), Det/CC, or a military distinguished visitor (DV) (equivalent to a USAF colonel or higher).

AARs and WINGS updates. ROs must document follow-up actions concerning leads and influencers who attended a COI within five business days of the event. The AAR is entered electronically and is logged in Teams under ROTC Recruiting Branch-ROs Det Cadre-Plans & AARs ROs All Regions. ROs are responsible for entering the lead contact information into WINGS.

### Tips and Recommendations from the Field
Make sure you are in contact with AFROTC/RRR well in advance of deadlines when you request approval for flyers/handouts/locally produced advertising. The RRR office is small and handles requests from all AFROTC detachments.

Know your university policy on “chalking,” literally drawing in the sidewalk with colored chalk, and the placement of campaign style yard signs. Some schools restrict when/where these things can be done but they are inexpensive ways to reach a large number of students in targeted locations, like next to the STEM library, coffee shops, or nursing college.

Does your school allow the hanging of banners in high traffic areas, like student unions or dining facilities? If so, take advantage of such opportunities.

Reach out to the marketing/advertising office on your host campus. A lot of them will make commercials and do advertising for the detachment for free. If you can get the school to fund the project, there are less restrictions on when and where the advertisement can be used.

Think outside the box! Use advertising funds to purchase advertising space on parking meters during a football game (pay for parking and place advertising on the meters), work with university marketing department to create table tents for student centers or cafeterias, purchase advertisements for STEM dorms, etc.

Purchase advertisements in key influencer, feeder high school, and local STEM organization publications.

Focus your COI events on diversity, STEM, and influencers. Invite subject matter experts to attend your COI event. If you’re targeting STEM majors and don’t have a STEM officer at your detachment, ask another officer in your region or closest USAF unit to support your event. If you are targeting a minority market, ensure a minority cadre member is in attendance or invite one from the surrounding area. It is important for potential cadets to see people like themselves in the AFROTC program and already serving.

Invite a guest speaker or person of significant influence (e.g. distinguished alumni) to give your COI personnel an idea of their future trajectory after completing the AFROTC program.

Work with the local school districts to find out when they are training their guidance counselors prior to the start of school and arrange a COI event there. University admissions officers, university freshman orientation personnel, parent-based groups (high school parent teacher association or organization (PTA/PTO)), Boy Scout and Girl Scout leadership training events may provide a great COI opportunity.

## CHAPTER 5 – DETACHMENT WEBSITE AND SOCIAL MEDIA
### Overview. 
The easiest means of advertising is through a detachment website and social media. ROs should make every effort possible to establish and maintain a detachment-specific website on their host university server.

### Guidance
Detachments must abide by the list of required items for detachment websites and ensure compliance with applicable restrictions including but not limited to AFROTC Instruction (AFROTCI) 36-2011, Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-332, AFI 35-107, DoD 5400.78R/AR Supplement 1 and USAF Social Media Guide (http://www.af.mil/AF-Sites/Social-Media-Sites/). The Air Force (AF) Form 2519 (website checklist) can be found on Teams ROTC-Recruiting Branch (RRR)- ROTC-Recruiting Branch (RRR)-General-Files-RO Training, Continuity, Guides, and Templates-Website Review Checklist.

### Approval Process
Approval for detachment websites by Air University Public Affairs (AU/PA) and AFROTC/RRR is required annually. All changes to the detachment website within the approved annual cycle, must be resubmitted for approval. To receive approval, detachment cadre may submit a completed AF Form 2519 to AU/PA by emailing Mr. John Coyle at john.coyle.4@us.af.mil. Upon approval by AU/PA, submit the completed form to AFROTC/RRR by emailing Ms. Linda Colvin at linda.colvin@us.af.mil. Retain a copy of the approved AF Form 2519 and AFROTC/RRR approval email in your continuity file.

### Requirements. 
All AFROTC detachment websites must include the following items:

#### USAF Symbol
Detachments will prominently display the USAF and Space Force symbol on each website homepage. The symbol must maintain original proportions (not stretched vertically or horizontally). The symbol must also maintain separation from other elements on the page and be clearly distinguishable from the background.

Additional guidance concerning the USAF and Space Force symbol is available at http://www.trademark.af.mil/.

#### General Detachment Information
Detachment websites must contain accurate and information and links. Each top-level page must contain the detachment’s name and logo, telephone number, and an organizational e-mail or feedback form.

Cadet and alumni pages must be password protected. Pages should not contain FOUO information (information exempt from release under the Freedom of Information Act), critical information, operational security information (OPSEC), or sensitive mission data that by itself is unclassified but when combined with other available data may reveal classified information.

#### Cadre Biographies
The only biographies/names posted on the site should be those of Air Force officers, enlisted and staff civilians who interact with the general public for recruiting purposes. No biographies or lists of cadets may be posted.

No personally identifiable information (PII), including personal e-mails, phone numbers, SSNs, birth dates, family members’ names may appear on any detachment website. One e-mail address for legitimate inquiries or page maintenance is acceptable but it must be organizational/generic.

#### Links to Outside Sources.
The detachment homepage must contain links to www.af.mil, www.spaceforce.mil, www.airforce.com, the Holm Center, (www.airuniversity.af.edu/Holm-Center), AFROTC Recruiting, (www.afrotc.com) and the AF FOIA site, (www.compliance.af.mil). As the website must reside on the host institution webserver, links to related host institution pages (excluding the university donation page) are acceptable.

Detachment pages should not be copies of other sources on the internet and should not link to outside sources or content not affiliated with the host institution or functional mission.

No detachment website should contain links to any solicitation for donations. Pages may not be used to promote personal/commercial gain and must not endorse commercial products or services.

#### Graphics, Pictures, and Media Content.
Images and amplifying content must be appropriate and professional. Detachment cadre are responsible for certifying all media content included on the website.

Content protected by copyright, including music accompanying videos, is not authorized. Professional photos may only be included with a written release from the owner.

All videos must include transcripts or closed captioning to comply with Title 10 United States Code § 508 usability requirements for people with disabilities.

#### Social Media
All detachments with social media accounts must ensure the cadre is approving all content before it is posted. Likewise, the ability to post needs to be controlled and delegated to one individual for accountability and security purposes to include protecting login and password information.

### Tips and Recommendations
Maximize the use of social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, etc.) to communicate scholarships, diversity, and opportunities that AFROTC provides. Please tag the main AFROTC Facebook and Instagram pages when you post on your detachment page or use #afrotc. The Facebook name is Air Force ROTC and the Instagram name is @usafrotc.

Day in the life of a cadet and detachment videos are great recruiting tools. A few examples can be found on the RRR Intranet site.

## CHAPTER 6 – HIGH SCHOOL SCHOLARSHIP PRESENTATIONS
### Overview
One of the most worthwhile and effective recruiting opportunities is the presentation of high school scholarships at high schools in your local area. These presentations typically reach a large target audience of influencers and future prospects. Detachment personnel should make every effort to support these presentations. AFROTC scholarship presenters must wear service dress.

### Guidance
RDAs will manage the high school presentation process within their regions. If detachment cadre are unable to support a request, ROs should coordinate with local AFJROTC detachment personnel, ALOs, and local officer and enlisted recruiters to see if they are available to support the request. Scholarship presentations should be scheduled and documented in the HSSP presentations section in WINGS.

### Process
Ceremony information to include location, presenter information, and notes should be entered into WINGS. In WINGS, Click HSSP > Individual Presentation Info > enter scholarship recipient’s name > enter applicable information. Please see attachment 4 for more information.

### Resources
A presentation certificate can be found in WINGS. 
- Click HSSP > Individual Presentation Info > enter scholarship recipient’s name > Click Print Certificate at the bottom of the screen.

## ATTACHMENT 1 - COI EVENT REQUEST EXAMPLES 
Example 1 – High School Shadow Day Lunch Presentation.
How will funding be used? Our host university supports an annual shadow day for high school seniors and their parents. We have solicited the participating students and asked if they are interested in learning more about the AFROTC program. This year’s shadow day is scheduled for Friday, 22 October from 0900-1800L. At 1200L, the RO will escort students and parents over to the detachment for a presentation and lunch (McAlister’s sandwiches, chips, and drinks). We will have approximately two hours for LLAB, presentations, and lunch before the students need to return to the main group.
Objective: Capitalize on university’s shadow day by creating a separate AFROTC event. This will increase AFROTC visibility at our host university by allowing interested high school students to observe a LLAB, receive briefings on the AFROTC program, and learn about HSSP opportunities.
Comments: This event is our single largest event with support from the university admissions office and student center. Historically this event reaches a vast majority of our following year freshmen.
How will the attendees receive information about AFROTC? The RO and cadet wing commander will provide a presentation, and we will offer one-on-one time with cadre and current cadets for a question and answer session (Q&A).
Civilian Attendance: 170 (Leads: 60, Influencers: 110); Military Attendance: 7

---

Example 2 – University Key Faculty Members Luncheon.
How will funding be used? Provide a lunch (Chick-fil-A nuggets, fries, and drinks) for university admissions office, guidance counselors and key department faculty members (Engineering, Math, Aviation, Nursing, Foreign Language). We blocked 45 minutes after the admissions office staff meeting to present a formal briefing, eat lunch, and answer questions.
Objective: Explain the AFROTC program to key university personnel, so they have a better understanding of the program, can inform students about AFROTC opportunities, and can direct qualified students to the detachment.
How will the attendees receive information about AFROTC? The detachment commander will give a presentation in the admissions conference room, we will provide brochures and have a POC cadet and the RO available for a Q&A.
Civilian Attendance: 15 (Leads: 0, Influencers: 15); Military Attendance: 3

---

Example 3 – Engineering Club Meeting.
How will funding be used? Purchase pizza and drinks for members of the Engineering and Technology Club at one of our cross-town universities. Members will receive a formal AFROTC presentation at the beginning of one of their bi-monthly meetings.
Objective: Our goal is to increase AFROTC awareness and visibility amongst highly qualified students at one of our underrepresented cross-towns. We received a list of academically qualified freshmen in the engineering department from the registrar’s office and have discovered that most of them are members of the Engineering and Technology Club. After the president opens the meeting, we will explain the AFROTC program, in-college scholarship program (ICSP) opportunities, and USAF job opportunities.
How will the attendees receive information about AFROTC? We invited a developmental engineer from a local AFB to share her personal story, the RO will provide a general AFROTC presentation and we will have a POC cadet (engineering major) share his AFROTC experience.
Civilian Attendance: 30 (Leads: 30, Influencers: 0); Military Attendance: 3
